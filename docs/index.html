<p>Hi there, Here I’ll explain what I’ve done so far. I used Google Earth Engine (GEE) to compute layers at 1km resolution. I already sent in a google drive the first batch of layers, which were for getting the table ready for the matching analysis. Now, the second batch of layers are from mapbiomas collections to get reclassified land-use transitions per year: 1) natural to natural, 2) natural to transformed and 3) water. Below, I will go into more detail of each batch of layers.</p>
<p>Also, you can explore the layers in this GEE app, here:</p>
<p><a href="https://fercholis.users.earthengine.app/view/terraindigenavisual" class="uri">https://fercholis.users.earthengine.app/view/terraindigenavisual</a></p>
<p><br></p>
<div id="first-batch-for-matching-analysis" class="section level1">
<h1>First batch (for matching analysis)</h1>
<p>The first batch, and a recap from my last email, I created 1km-layers for the matching analysis. We decided to have few layers to match control pixels for the ones inside Indigenous Lands (IL). These layers are based on known factors affecting deforestation such as accessibility, distance to roads, human population density, biome. We also decided to exclude Conservation Units (CU) from the analysis to follow the reviewer’s comment on protected areas. Then, I created a table where each row has the pixel id, coordinates, and values for each layer.</p>
<p>Layers, table and script to make the table are in this folder:</p>
<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GEy39jdoKdShx4gk2dTxjuOvETq4xJHR" class="uri">https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GEy39jdoKdShx4gk2dTxjuOvETq4xJHR</a></p>
<p>Here is a more detailed explanation of each layer:</p>
<p><br></p>
<div id="indigenous-lands" class="section level3">
<h3>Indigenous Lands</h3>
<p>For this layer, the pixel is either the id code of the Indigenous land or 0. I called the IL polygons directly from the mapbiomas project in GEE and then transformed it into a 1-km raster.</p>
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html/IL%20layer-1.png" width="672" /></p>
</div>
<div id="conservation-units-4-layers" class="section level3">
<h3>Conservation Units (4 layers)</h3>
<p>These layers had the same procedure as IL. The pixel is either the id code of the CU or 0. I There are four CU datasets in mapbiomas project in GEE: 1) Federal Integral, 2) Federal Sustainable Use, 3) State Integral, 2) State Sustainable Use. There are individual 1-km layers for each CU type, but I masked them all out indiscriminately for the analysis.</p>

</div>
<div id="accessibility-to-cities-2015" class="section level3">
<h3>Accessibility to cities (2015)</h3>
<p>This layer comes from the Malaria Atlas Project et al. It is now deprecated as they created a new one in 2019 (see next layer). They calculated the time to travel to a populated area based on existing roads, rivers, topography, etc., by creating a friction map (e.g., moving through a road is faster than walking through the jungle).</p>

<div id="distance-to-roads-3-layers" class="section level3">
<h3>Distance to roads (3 layers)</h3>
<p>Here there are two shapefiles that Carlos sent: <em>malha_viaria</em> and <em>roads8_dis_sad</em>. I’m not aware of their difference neither their source. We calculated the distance using Alejandro’s script for both shapefiles and for the unified version of both. These are named: <em>dist_malha</em>, <em>dist_roads8</em> and <em>dist_road</em>, respectively.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: I had to export again <em>dist_road</em> because I just found that there was an error when exporting it from GEE (see below), so that is reflected in the table. The re-exported version is correct and I updated the table.</p>

<p>This layer comes from the RESOLVE Ecoregions dataset. There are 846 terrestrial ecoregions grouped into 14 biomes. I selected biomes for simplicity and transformed the polygons into a 1-km raster.</p>

<h1>Second batch (mapbiomas land use change)</h1>
<p>Here I reclassified values from mapbiomas transition layers in collection v3.1 and collection v6 for each year. Additionally, I did the same for a single transition layer from the beginning to the end of the study period (i.e., 1985 to 2017 for collection v3.1 and 1985 to 2020 for collection v6).</p>
<p><br></p>
<div id="reclassification" class="section level3">
<h3>reclassification</h3>
<p>Then I defined three types of transitions: 1) natural to natural (remain), 2) natural to transformed (transf) and 3) water (in case we need to exclude pixels having more water than land). All other transitions types were masked (see table below). Each reclassified pixel was multiplied by its area and then aggregated to the 1-km. So, there are 1-km layers of the area for each reclassified transition per year.</p>

<p>I think the idea is to get the proportion of natural land being transformed as our response variable or the opposite. Then we can fit a logistic regression in the post-matching analysis.</p>
